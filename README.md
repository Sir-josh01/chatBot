## Overview

This project is a functional, interactive **ChatBot User Interface (UI)** built to demonstrate real-time message handling and dynamic rendering. It simulates a conversational flow, focusing on component-based architecture and state management.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
* Input messages and see them instantly appear in the chat window.
* See simulated automated responses from the ChatBot.
* View a responsive layout that adapts for both desktop and mobile screens.
* Experience smooth state transitions when sending and receiving messages.

## My process
- The interface was developed using a component-driven approach. Messages are stored in a central state, and the UI re-renders dynamically upon every user submission or simulated bot response. Focus was placed on clean message bubble design and smooth scrolling.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### ⚙️ Installation & Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd chatbot-project
    ```
3.  Open the main file: Right-click `index.html` (or the root component) and select 'Open with Live Server' or open directly in your browser.

### What I learned

Key achievements and takeaways from this project:

* **State Management:** Successfully managing the array of messages and ensuring the UI updates correctly upon modification.
* **Dynamic Scrolling:** Implementing logic to automatically scroll the chat window to the bottom upon the addition of a new message.
* **Component Modularity:** Structuring the Chat Input and Message Display as reusable, independent components.

### Continued development

Future enhancements for the ChatBot include:

1.  Integrating a real backend API for actual response generation.
2.  Adding user authentication and session management.
3.  Implementing typing indicators and time stamps for messages.
